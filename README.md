# SEQUENCE-DETECTOR-USING-SYNOPSYS
A Sequence Detector identifies a specific bit pattern (e.g., 1011) in a serial input stream using an FSM. Designed using Synopsys Tools, it involves:  FSM Design – Defines states for detecting the sequence.  RTL Implementation – Written in Verilog/VHDL and synthesized using Design Compiler.  Simulation &amp; Verification – Done with VCS
